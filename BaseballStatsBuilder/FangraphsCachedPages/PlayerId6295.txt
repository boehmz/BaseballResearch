That's the question surrounding Red Sox uber-prospect Xander Bogaerts as he continues his meteoric rise to Boston. Unlike many shortstop prospects, Bogaerts has the hitting ability to make an impact anywhere on the diamond. Fortunately for the Red Sox and fantasy owners alike, his defense has improved to the point where shortstop is a real possibility instead of wishful thinking. For fantasy owners, few prospects are as valuable as Bogaerts. With the hype machine working overtime, it makes little sense to trade for him in dynasty leagues. The price tag will be exorbitant. In 2013, Bogaerts may receive a late season callup, but a 2014 ETA is more likely -- especially if he sticks at shortstop. Even with his success, Bogaerts is not a finished product and needs additional time to add the final touches at the minor league level. (<a href="http://www.rotoscouting.com/">Mike Newman</a>)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>The upper reaches of Bogaerts' ceiling may be determined by his ability to stick at shortstop.

He has a potent bat with fierce bat speed and power to spare for a middle infielder. Whether he plays the middle infield in 2014 is still a question mark with the team's continued pursuit of Stephen Drew. In either case, Manager John Farrell has seemed to indicate that Bogaerts will play plenty in Boston this year -- likely at the expense of Will Middlebrooks if Drew is brought back. Bogaerts has the talent to be an asset at third base or shortstop. Help in home runs, RBI's, a strong batting average (though his strikeout rate may have a say in this matter) and five-to-ten stolen bases are all possible from one of the brighter young talents in the game. Eligibility at third and short is a nice bonus as well.  (Al Skorupa)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Bogaerts seems poised to be a significant fantasy contributor in four or five categories as a 21-year-old.

            "profile": "Bogaerts, a rising star in the league, is coming off a disappointing season by most accounts, although you wouldn’t have guessed that by his slash line (.273/.343/.403). Even with Bogaerts' batting average in a three-year decline (15’ – .320, 16’ – .294, 17' – .273), his 2017 average is still almost 20 points above what the league average is, but when compared to the other 144 qualified hitters last year, he ranks just 64th. As one of Bogaerts' main contributions, you’d like to see his batting average a little higher than top 70 of 144 hitters. Also, a little alarming is that his xBA (Expected Batting Average) according to Statcast last season was just .231. That is a sizeable gap between his actual batting average and ranks 150th of 183 batters who had over 400 at-bats last season. On the plate skills side of things, Bogaerts maintains a very patient approach only swinging at 42% of the pitches he sees, but oddly enough, his pitch selection is pretty awful. Of all the qualified hitters in baseball last year (144), Bogaerts has the smallest swing gap between pitches in the strike zone (53% Z-Swing%) and pitches outside the strike zone (33% O-Swing%). The strange part about this is, he is very selective at what he swings at but then wastes that patience by offering at seemly bad pitches. (Keith Farnsworth)",
