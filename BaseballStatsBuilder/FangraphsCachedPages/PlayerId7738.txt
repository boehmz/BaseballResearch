He was one of three players to finish the season with at least ten home runs, 30 stolen bases, and a .350 on base percentage -- joining teammate Ryan Braun and phenom Mike Trout in that exclusive group. His approach relies on ground balls and his speed. As Mike Petriello notes, Aoki led the league in infield hits and only seven qualified hitters had a higher ground ball percentage than the 31-year-old outfielder last season. Though fantasy owners should not expect double-digit home runs from Aoki again (those ground balls), they can be confident that he'll provide a high batting average and ample stolen bases, and if he continues to hit atop the Brewers' batting order, he should also rack up the run totals. He's not anyone to reach for on draft day, but Norichika Aoki projects to be a solid final outfielder in most formats and could potentially drop in some drafts due to a lack of name-recognition. (JP Breen)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>A pleasant surprise in 2012, Aoki provides fantasy owners a little bit of value in most categories without sacrificing batting average in the process.

He should also bat leadoff for what should be an above-average Royals offense. That would continue to make the 32-year-old outfielder a solid source of runs and stolen bases. However, Aoki has separated himself from guys like Denard Span and Michael Bourn by his potential for double-digit home runs. Miller Park played a significant part in his 18 homers over the past two seasons. A move to Kauffman Stadium should dial the power expectations back, and we're now grouping him with Span and Bourn (unless we're talking an on-base percentage league, where Aoki is more valuable). He projects to hang around the top-50 outfielders once again. Fantasy owners should simply be sure to factor in the probable power decline when evaluating him for the 2014 season. (JP Breen)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Moving away from hitter-friendly Miller Park should make Aoki's power output rather negligible, but he still projects as a borderline top-50 outfielder, providing batting average, runs and steals.

He has almost no power, but is so difficult to strike out that it is tough to imagine him not hitting .280.
