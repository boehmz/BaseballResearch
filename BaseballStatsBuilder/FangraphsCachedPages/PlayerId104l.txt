Oh, Gee did put up nicer strikeout rates in the minor leagues, but he doesn't own prototypical strikeout stuff and works backwards off of a mediocre fastball. If he finds the mojo he showed in the minor leagues, a slightly above-average strikeout rate (8 K/9 in minors), paired with an above-average walk rate (1.9 in minors), is definitely possible. Unfortunately, a slightly above-average Major League starter does not make for a great fantasy starter, and without his work as a 24-year-old in Triple-A, even his modest strikeout rate would look a lot worse. Given his (actually) inauspicious beginnings, mixed leaguers should definitely take a wait-and-see approach with Gee, and deeper-leaguers shouldn't spend anything but a late-round flier on Gee-licious. (Eno Sarris)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Don't be fooled by his pristine ERA -- Dillon Gee doesn't have the strikeouts or stuff to be an elite fantasy starter, even when he puts up work more commensurate with his minor-league work. </td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

It's unclear how much upside he has remaining. Gee's fastball doesn't crack 90 and the trademarked control he showed in the Minor Leagues didn't travel with him to the big leagues. Watch him pitch and no single pitch stands out -- only his changeup really gets any whiffs. His curve is okay, too, but he only uses it about 10% of the time. Bottom line -- even if he regains some of his old level of control and gets strikeouts more line with his average-ish swinging strike rate, he's not likely to be much better than a decent final starter in deeper leagues. Watch and wait. (Eno Sarris)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>In the minors, Gee "Unit" didn't walk anyone so it was okay that he didn't really strike people out. Now, he's worse than average with the control, and still not getting the strikeouts. And the Mets are moving in the walls. Remember the name, but don't draft him. </td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

Gee did begin throwing again before the end of last season, and is expected to be healthy for next year. But the injury does make him a pretty big question. That's a shame, as Gee saw some nice improvement last year. His minor-league walk rates translated to the majors, and he upped his strikeout rate by nearly 5% -- which seems to be sustainable, given his well-above-average swinging strike rate (10.6%, good for 19th in the league among pitchers with more than 100 innings pitched). He's one of the players to keep an eye on this spring, even if his fastball is meh. If he proves to be effective during March, and his secondary stuff looks sharp, he could be a solid late-round sleeper. If he looks bad, it will be tough to invest a draft pick in him coming off surgery.

Without standout “stuff" other than a good change up, he has done this largely by mixing up four pitches, limiting walks, and benefiting from a neutral-to-friendly home park. Gee has a rotation spot in Flushing in 2014 but projects to be useful in standard mixed leagues more as a situational play. He’ll be an injury fill-in and a streamer. Pitchers with mediocre stuff like Gee often wind up spending time on the waiver wire as well as short stints on numerous teams throughout the season. He has minimal upside, but won’t exactly hurt you. He doesn’t need to be drafted or purchased on draft day. In weekly leagues, he will probably make a decent option in two-start weeks with neutral to favorable match-ups. In NL-only leagues, he projects as the fantasy equivalent of an innings eater in roto formats, depending on league innings settings. Ideally, owners should be looking for players with more upside late in the draft, but he is a player who shouldn’t really hurt you and is slated for a full season of starts. (Derek Ambrosino)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Dillon Gee is basically a league average pitcher. He has limited upside and unspectacular weapons, but mixes his stuff up effectively enough and limited free passes. In standard mixed leagues, he can be ignored on draft day, but is sound enough to be attractive in two-start weeks for weekly leaguers, especially at home or against weak offenses. NL-only leaguers wishing to fill out their staffs could do worse, but are unlikely to reap any sort of breakout.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

His contact and swinging-strike rate backed up those outcomes, too. The components and outcomes reversed in 2013, and he wound up with a 3.62 ERA, 1.28 WHIP so some continued to think he would be a 2014 fantasy asset. The changeup and curve are still good, but he relies most on his fourseam and sinker, which prevent contact the least. His contact rate jumped to 84% last season, which is the 26th-worst rate for starting pitchers over 90 innings pitched: 0.1% better than Jon Niese. The Mets will probably look to fill in their roster requirements by trading Dillon Gee.  (<a href="https://twitter.com/RotoBanter">Dan Schwartz</a>)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>6.16 strikeouts per nine do not earn you a spot on your fantasy rosters outside of NL-only leagues.

In 2015, Gee managed just 40 major league innings, spending the bulk of his season in the minors both because of injury issues and declining effectiveness. Since his best statistical season in 2012, Gee has experienced a three year decline in strikeout rate, ending in 5.7 strikeouts per nine season last year. The Mets let Gee walk this offseason, and he landed a minor league deal with the Mets’ World Series opponent, the Royals. The Royals are an attractive destination for pitchers because of their excellent defensive play. Their 56 Defensive Runs Saved were third most in baseball, although the bulk of that success came in the outfield, which benefits the roundball-heavy Gee (51% ground ball rate) less than most. For Gee to really rebound, he will likely need to a change in his mechanics or pitch mix -- at his best, Gee had a FIP of around 4.00 with average strikeout to walk ratios. Even with the defensive upgrade, Gee will probably be capped as a spot starter in deeper formats. He may not even make the big league team. (Scott Spratt)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Dillon Gee will have a chance to turn around his three year declining performance on the World Series champion Royals, whose defensive play can only help. Still, Gee’s best seasons were only marginally useful in fantasy. His upside may not be worth the gamble.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

The light-throwing righty strikes out few batters (6.4 K's per nine) while getting hit around a bit (1.7 homers per nine and a .309 batting average on balls in play). He limits walks (2.7 BB/9) but it isn’t enough. The Royals tried to see if he could pull a Wade Davis and thrive in the bullpen. That was a failure, however, as Gee’s production plummeted. The Rangers have a decent bullpen and aren’t trying to tank, so Gee may find himself in the Rangers rotation until Tyson Ross gets healthy. He may not, however. Even with the opportunity, he shouldn’t be rostered in most formats.
