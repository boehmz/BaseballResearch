He stole 19 bases in 447 plate appearances last year and is a good bet to steal 20+ if he gets 500+ PA as Steamer projects him to do. He doesn't walk a ton, but he also makes a lot of contact, and should be able to maintain a decent batting average because of his contact skills and speed. Both Inciarte and Peralta feel like guys you add when you have to replace an injured player in 12-team mixed leagues. But Inciarte is the type of guy you add once the season gets going and you realize you're a little light on speed. In deeper leagues, Inciarte is a nice later round target for steals.

He played all three outfield spots incredibly well, which increases his overall utility. He was expected to be in a platoon with pitcher-turned-outfielder David Peralta, but Inciarte's production was so good, the Diamondbacks had to find a spot for him. He played mostly right field because Yasmany Tomas had a disappointing first season. He also picked up in center field when A.J. Pollock missed some time. His skill-set at the plate is about contact, so he doesn't hit for a lot of power -- and probably never will. Even his 2015 produced just a .105 isolated slugging percentage, but he was able to be productive in other ways. He used his speed to get on base when he hit the ball. He had the sixth-best contact rate in the majors and produced a 52.4% ground ball rate, good for 20th in the majors. He also spread the ball around the field, almost equally sending balls in play to the center, pull, and opposite fields. He was traded to the Atlanta Braves along with Dansby Swanson and Aaron Blair for Shelby Miller. Unless he's traded again, he could be one of the Braves' most productive players this side of Freddie Freeman.

Even his home run total reached double digits in 2017, although I wouldn’t bank on that repeating in 2018. He is a low launch angle, low exit velocity guy who is better served peppering line drives and using his legs to generate his value. And boy do those legs generate value, they carried him to a .304 batting average, 22 stolen bases, and 93 runs scored. With a full season of Albies, the eventual addition of Acuna, and the ever-great production out of Freddie Freeman, Inciarte could score more than 100 runs for the first time in his career and maybe even add a few more RBI if he’s lucky.
