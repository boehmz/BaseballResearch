Some have voiced some doubts about Segura's ability to stick at shortstop, but with Rickie Weeks present at second in Milwaukee, Segura is going to get his chances at shortstop. For fantasy purposes, Segura's defensive skills matter less than what position he plays, and shortstop is not exactly stacked, offensively speaking. That is a good thing, because Segura does not have many impressive offensive skills. He never walked much in the minors, and while he did not strike out that often, his strikeout rate was not fantastically low. He has never shown much power. He does have some speed, and is very athletic. He is young enough that there is room for development, and some observers feel like he could develop double-digit home run power along with 30 steals a season. Shortstop is a thin position, fantasy-wise, so Segura should get your attention on draft day. He probably is not a budding superstar, but he will probably be a sufficient starter on a small price in the short-term, with the possibility of something more down the road. (Matt Klaassen)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Segura does not look like he will be a fantasy machine, but with the starting shortstop job in Milwaukee in his hands, he instantly has fantasy value because of the position's low offensive baseline.

His late-season struggles were ascribed to fatigue -- which probably carries some truth -- but fantasy owners should be more concerned that his ground-ball rate spiked after the month of April. Five out of the last six months featured a ground-ball percentage over 59%. His power numbers fell accordingly. At his core, Segura is a high-average, high-steal shortstop with the potential to reach double-digit homers. That's very valuable in all fantasy formats. Prior to 2013, I said Segura could be a Jose Altuve type option at shortstop, and I think that comp remains relevant.

            "profile": "Segura enters 2018 as a career .283/.324/.402 hitter, much of which is buoyed by a career high .319/.368/.499 (20 home runs, 33 stolen bases) 2016 season in Arizona that he personally credited to a new stance and swing. Traded a season later to Seattle (and then locked up on a five-year contract extension), the 27-year-old Dominican shortstop took a very small step back last season, hitting just 11 home runs and swiping 22 stolen bases in an injury(ankle)-shortened season of 125 games (though he still managed to bat .300). The low walk but high contact skill set here sets a solid floor for Segura, and though a good deal of his recent MLB success can be attributed to running high BABIP’s, his rare combo of average power and plus speed (one of just four SS to steal at least 20 bases last year) give him a foundation to deliver an easy top-10 designation among SS heading into 2018 (with room for growth if he can continue to tweak his swing for improvement). (Trey Baughn)", 
            "quickProfile": "Some owners will assume that 2016 is the best we’ll ever see from Segura due to the benefits of playing in Arizona prior to the trade to the Mariners. However, Segura actually hit better at home in Seattle last season (.313/.364/.458 with .145 ISO) than he did on the road (.734 OPS), a fact that bodes well for 2018 development. Expectations for Segura in 2018 are best set somewhere in between the last two seasons, with a likely .300 AVG/15 HR/30 SB line setting him up to be one of the better values at the position."}]; </script>
