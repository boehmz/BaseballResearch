The affectionately nicknamed "Spellcheck" proceeded then to post a 3.81 ERA and 3.55 FIP through 28 starts and 174.2 innings. The former Notre Dame wide receiver now has the chance to take the ace role for the Cubs in 2013. Matt Garza had a down, injury-marred season in 2012, and he and Samardzija head into the season jostling for the Cubs top spot. Garza, the incumbent, should start the season as the team's "ace," but given that Samardzija had both a high batting average on balls in play (.296 in 2012, but .282 on his career) and home run per fly ball rate (12.8% in 2012, but 10.0% on his career), it seems reasonable the younger, comparatively healthier F7 could supplant Garza as the best pitcher on a rebuilding staff. Samardzija is definitely worth consideration in any fantasy league, and a continued breakout could make him a fantasy workhorse. (<a href="https://twitter.com/BradleyWoodrum">Bradley Woodrum</a>)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>His breakout season in 2012 may get even better in 2013 if his batting average on balls in play and home run per fly ball rates sink back down to his career rates. If his new role as a starter does not create a new normal in those metrics, then he could be the Cubs' top pitcher by the All-Star break, and an even hotter fantasy commodity.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

That's fine. But he does have the sixth-best strikeout rate in the league since he became a starter, and his walk rate has not been a problem. And his ground-ball rate is above average. And even though he's lost a little gas and is already 29 years old, he's throwing in the mid-nineties still (94.5 mph average last season). The former tight end's ligaments should be fresh! Platoon splits shouldn't be a problem, he has a slider and a split-finger, and those two have opposite splits. That's three plus pitches, okay control, and grounders. So what's missing here? Homers. The last two years, he's given up 13.1% home runs on fly balls for some reason -- the league average is under ten percent -- and that's made his ERA balloon to the high threes despite an xFIP in the low threes. If you believe that he's a Tim Lincecum type, and that his fastball command will always lead to homers, that's fine. But the Shark has Lincecum's old fastball, and splitter, and should at some point have his old numbers. To this writer, he's got everything an elite starter needs other than elite results on balls in play, and that's a recipe for a sleeper. Go get him. (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/enosarris">Eno Sarris</a>)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Top-ten strikeouts with average control and above-average ground ball rates -- backed by three plus pitches and gas? If you ignore the results on balls in play, Jeff Samardzija looks like an elite pitcher. Even if you're worried about the homers, he's an under-rated starter for the strikeouts alone.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

He has now proven that last year's ground-ball rate spike was no fluke, as he induced grounders on both his four-seam fastball and slider more frequently than he had been. Unfortunately, everything has not remained so rosy. The city of Chicago apparently couldn't live without him, as the South Siders traded for him, which in turn hurts his fantasy outlook. The White Sox home park sports one of the highest home run park factors in baseball and inflates overall run scoring as well. Samardzija has already dealt with home run issues in the past, posting home run per fly ball rates of at least 10.6% each season as a starter, all of which have been above the league average. The park switch isn't going to suddenly make him worthless in shallower mixed leagues, but will make it much more difficult for him to come close to a repeat of his 2014 performance. (<a href="https://www.projectingx.com" target="_blank" onclick="return false;">Mike Podhorzer</a>)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Samardzija's overall skills package peaked in 2014, as his control improved significantly driven by the highest first strike percentage of his career. But the move to the White Sox and a hitter-friendly home park is going to take a bite out of his fantasy value.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

And so it is that Samardzija finds himself with a five year, $90 million contract despite a 4.96 ERA in 2015, one that saw him lead the league in runs and hits allowed and has two major areas for concern lying underneath it. For one, Samardzija, normally a strikeout pitcher, stopped striking people out. After three and a half seasons where his strikeout rate didn't dip below 22.9%, he found himself striking out just 17.9% of batters, with a precipitous drop in swinging strike rate to accompany the change and without a drop in velocity as an easy explanation. He also lost his title as a ground ball pitcher, shifting nearly 10% of his batted balls from the ground to the air and seeing his hard hit percentage rise as a result. There is room for optimism, though, as Samardzija is moving to the easier circuit, will play in a pitcher's ballpark, and will have an elite defense behind him. Add in a shade of strikeout regression back toward the 20% mark, and The Shark might be able to hit the top 50 for SP. The issue with a potential bounce-back is that early average draft position returns suggest people are already paying for it, buying out any room for discount. (Blake Murphy)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>The league leader in hits and runs allowed was paid $90 million this offseason, with the Giants betting on a change in league, park, and defense can help restore Samardzija to top of the rotation status. That's possible, perhaps even likely, but beware an early spike in draft position buying out any discount.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

He was leaving a hitter-friendly park in the American League for arguably the most pitcher-friendly venue in the National League. He cut over a run off of his ERA, but even that sharp of an improvement felt underwhelming for those who still had his 2014 fresh in their mind. After five seasons in the rotation, it looks like ’14 was the outlier and something around ’16 is where expectations should lie with Shark. That 2014 season has been the only one where Samardzija was above average at shutting down lefties (.662 OPS). His 2016 mark of .780 was right in line with .762 over his career. The biggest difference between success and failure versus lefties is the fastball and splitter leaving the yard, whether season-to-season or even within 2016. Through his first 22 starts of the season, they hit six homers off the two pitches in 131 plate appearances. Over his final 10 starts, it was just two in 110. There is a modicum of upside if Samardzija can consistently stifle lefties; if not, he’s a quality middle of the rotation innings-eater in all formats. (<a href="http://twitter.com/sporer">Paul Sporer</a>)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Don’t buy Samardzija with any expectation of his 2014 heights returning. He has a path to improvement that could yield a season better than 2016, but pay for 200 solid innings and take anything better as pure profit.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>
