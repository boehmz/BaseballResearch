He even managed to contribute positively in batting average for the first time driven by a career best batting average on balls in play combined with an uptick in that HR/FB rate. The question now is how a weak lineup around him will affect his opportunity to score and drive in runs.

On an historically weak Marlins offense that easily scored the fewest runs in baseball, it was no surprise that Stanton was only able to muster 62 runs scored and batted in.

Now signed long-term in Miami, Stanton can focus on getting back into game shape after an errant pitch to the face prematurely ended his 2014 season. For all his brilliance and prodigious power, Stanton still struggled against sliders down and off the plate in 2014.

He had been chipping away at his strikeout rate for a few years running, but his 29.9% strikeout rate was his highest since his rookie season. Also bothersome, his walk rate was four percent lower than it was the two years prior. You could argue that Stanton was consciously trying to hit for more power at the expense of making as much contact because his ground ball to fly ball ratio shifted heavily towards the fly ball side last year. The question is whether that's a trade-off fantasy owners would like him to continue making. Early projections have him swinging back towards a little more plate discipline and 40 home runs as opposed to 50 with more whiffs. And when Stanton hit 37 home runs with a .288 average in 2014, he finished third in RotoGraphs' end of season fantasy values. Few hit for even 40 home run power anymore, so if Stanton keeps his average up at the expense of 50 home run power, he'll have a power/average combo almost no one puts up anymore.  (Brett Talley)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Stanton missed half of 2015 with a broken hamate bone, but when on the field he seemed to be trading some improved plate discipline back for more elevation and extra power and was on pace for 50 home runs.

Last year, it was a groin strain which took him out in August, though he came back for sporadic appearances near the end of the season. Even before he got hurt, though, Stanton was showing some signs of concern. Stanton continued his apparent trend of being even more aggressive at the plate, with his strikeout and walk rates remaining virtually constant, at 29.8% and 10.6%, respectively, compared to 2015. His swinging strike rate stood steady at an abnormally high 15.2%, and his overall swing rate actually increased from 45.2% to 46.2%. But Stanton's freeswinging ways didn't lead to the same boost in power that they did in 2015; Stanton's HR/FB rate fell sharply from 32.1% to 22.7%, and his hard-hit rate suffered a similar drop from 49.7% to 42.9%. Stanton's batted ball profile also took a dive -- literally -- as a good chunk of his line drives turned into grounders. Stanton's at his peak, age-wise, and he has more raw power than anyone in the game, but this still all adds up to an outfielder who might have more of a 35-.250 season in 2017 than a 45-.290 season. And that, of course, is if he stays healthy. Stanton could easily be a top-5 fantasy player if things break right, but his potential downside is too great to make him more than a mid-tier OF1 this spring. (Brice Russ)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Stanton got hurt -- again -- in 2016. More distressingly, he maintained his even-higher strikeout rates from 2015 while giving back the gains he made in game power. Few players in baseball have more potential than Giancarlo, but his downside is significant enough to make him a risky pick as more than a borderline second/third round player.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

Last year, it was a groin strain which took him out in August, though he came back for sporadic appearances near the end of the season. Even before he got hurt, though, Stanton was showing some signs of concern. Stanton continued his apparent trend of being even more aggressive at the plate, with his strikeout and walk rates remaining virtually constant, at 29.8% and 10.6%, respectively, compared to 2015. His swinging strike rate stood steady at an abnormally high 15.2%, and his overall swing rate actually increased from 45.2% to 46.2%. But Stanton's freeswinging ways didn't lead to the same boost in power that they did in 2015; Stanton's HR/FB rate fell sharply from 32.1% to 22.7%, and his hard-hit rate suffered a similar drop from 49.7% to 42.9%. Stanton's batted ball profile also took a dive -- literally -- as a good chunk of his line drives turned into grounders. Stanton's at his peak, age-wise, and he has more raw power than anyone in the game, but this still all adds up to an outfielder who might have more of a 35-.250 season in 2017 than a 45-.290 season. And that, of course, is if he stays healthy. Stanton could easily be a top-5 fantasy player if things break right, but his potential downside is too great to make him more than a mid-tier OF1 this spring. (Brice Russ)", 
            "quickProfile": "Stanton got hurt -- again -- in 2016. More distressingly, he maintained his even-higher strikeout rates from 2015 while giving back the gains he made in game power. Few players in baseball have more potential than Giancarlo, but his downside is significant enough to make him a risky pick as more than a borderline second/third round player."},{"season": "2018",
            "profile": "Stanton played in 150 games for the first time since 2011 and just the second time in eight MLB seasons, and rewarded owners with an absolutely ridiculous season. Not only did Stanton hit an insane .281/.376/.631, but he mashed 59 homers after combining for 54 over the previous two seasons. Now he's headed to the Bronx, which is like a Little League stadium when compared to Marlins Park. He's guaranteed at least three years in a Yankees uniform with his current contract, and if he stays healthy, there's really no reason he can't threaten 175-180 homers over that stretch. That'd put him nearing 450 by the age of 31. Insanity. (<a href='https://twitter.com/brandon_warne'>Brandon Warne</a>)", 
            "quickProfile": "He's going from a park with an 80 home-run park factor (100 is average) for righties to one with a mark of 124. He's going to wreck shit if he can stay healthy. "}]; </script>
