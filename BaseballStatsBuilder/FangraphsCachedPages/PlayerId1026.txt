Felix Hernandez, Tim Lincecum, maybe Tommy Hanson now: every fifth day or so they represent the future of their respective franchises. Gallardo is that way for the Brew Crew. And if Milwaukee fans had high hopes for the young right-hander going into the 2009 season, they weren't disappointed. He didn't have anything even resembling a gaudy win total (going just 13-12), but Gallardo was able to post an excellent 3.97 FIP along with 204 K in 185.2 IP. The inning totals are important, given Gallardo's injury-plagued 2008, during which he threw all of 24.0 IP before the playoffs came back to Milwaukee. It was for the sake of preserving Gallardo that the Brewers shut him down after his 30th start in 2009.<br /><br /><b>The Year Ahead: </b>Barring any huge free-agent signings this offseason (an unlikely contingency, given Milwaukee's spending habits), Gallardo will enter the 2010 season as the uncontested No. 1 starter for the Brewers. Given that he'll be only 24, it's not unreasonable to expect even more progress. What does progress look like for a guy who already averages over a K per inning? Well, walk rate is one area in which Gallardo could stand to improve. For all his other virtues, Gallardo still walked 4.56 per nine in 2009. That hurts his WHIP and ERA. Beyond that, durability will be a concern. To really attain "ace" status in the major leagues, Gallardo will have to prove that he can pitch 200 IP without incident. If the Brewers are anything like contenders, it's possible they'll ask Gallardo to do just that. (Carson Cistulli)</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

He continued to strike batters out at a tremendous rate (9.7 K/9) and cut down on free passes by nearly a full point to 3.6 per nine innings. As such, he produced a 3.02 FIP that could be a sign of things to come. Unfortunately, a porous Brewers defense let him down at times, resulting in the ERA nearly a full run higher than his FIP. Next season, there's no reason to believe that the defense will be significantly better, especially with Lorenzo Cain traded to Kansas City. A Prince Fielder trade would potentially help. Gallardo is a lock to be among the league leaders in strikeouts and to produce a good, if not fantastic, ERA and win total. Gallardo shouldn't be the cornerstone of your fantasy staff in mixed leagues, but he is truly an ace now and deserves an early look in fantasy leagues this year and is extremely valuable in keeper or dynasty leagues. (Jack Moore)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Gallardo made a step towards becoming an ace last season. He's a strikeout artist and she be able to boost your staff in every category.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

The key? A decline in walk rate, from 3.65 per nine innings to 2.56; from 9.3% to 6.8%. This allowed him to pitch over 200 innings for the first time in his career, giving his bullpen better chances to hold leads and giving him more chances for strikeouts. We'll see if he can maintain this improvement at 26, but if he can, a drop back to his career home-run-per-fly-ball mark of 10% could lead to a borderline ace season. (Jack Moore)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Gallardo took another step forward in 2011, suppressing walks and continuing to post an excellent strikeout rate due to pinpoint control of the fastball. Look for him to post ace-like numbers for the Brewers in 2012.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

Home run issues have prevented him from becoming a True Ace, but he still has a tremendous fantasy profile. He combines consistent strikeouts -- at one per inning each of the last four seasons -- with durability -- at least 30 starts -- and a solid offense behind him to pile up the wins. Expect a mid-3.00s ERA, double-digit wins and 200 strikeouts again. Those numbers look pretty good near the top of a fantasy staff. (Jack Moore)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Gallardo has been consistently good now for four years, and there's little reason to expect much change in 2013.

He's never provided value with his WHIP, as his walk rate is annually above average, but last year, the ERA topped four and the strikeouts dropped significantly to 7.17 per nine. Furthermore, his fastball velocity decreased for the second consecutive season. He averaged 92.7 mph on his fastball in 2011 and only 90.7 mph in 2013. Such a decrease hints at an arm injury or increased ineffectiveness, both of which should scare fantasy owners. The bottom also fell out of his swinging-strike rate. His SwStr% was only 6.9% in 2013, which was the eighth-worst mark in all of baseball amongst qualified starters. Some owners have pointed to his 3.09 ERA in the second half as reason for optimism, even dubbing him a buy-low candidate for the upcoming season. It's worth noting, though, his strikeout rate actually decreased further in the second half to 7.12 K/9. Between the velocity issues, strikeout and swinging-strike declines, and the perennially-high WHIP, too many red flags exist for me to advocate targeting Gallardo as a buy-low candidate for 2014. I'd look elsewhere. (JP Breen)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>The 28-year-old hurler was once a future fantasy ace in the making, but he's fallen on hard times and was barely a top-100 starter in 2013. Some owners may see a bounce-back candidate based upon his second half. Too many red flags exist, however, to inspire much confidence heading into the upcoming season.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

Between 2009 and 2012, he never struck out fewer than nine batters per nine or had an ERA over four. When his strikeout rate plummeted to 7.2 batters per nine in 2013, some hoped it was a fluke and that he could rebound in 2014. That was not the case. Instead, Gallardo’s strikeout rate fell further to 6.8 per nine. Despite a slight rebound in his fastball velocity, to 2012 levels, and a 3.51 ERA that was a career best in a full season, his peripheral numbers were uninspiring. And Gallardo continues to give up a lot of home runs, a problem that will likely not be remedied with a return to Milwaukee. Gallardo is draftable in most formats, but you should not expect him to perform as a top-60 starter. (Scott Spratt)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>A few things like an increase in velocity and a drop in walk rate suggested a rebound for Gallardo in 2014, but his strikeout rate fell even further from his sharp decline in 2013. Couple that with his traditionally high WHIP and home run tendencies, and Gallardo is a bench starter with limited upside in standard formats.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

Given comparable deals, Gallardo should have been in line for something in the four-year, $56-million range, as a 29-year-old righty who's been remarkably consistent for seven seasons has earned such a payday by market standards. That consistency, by the way, includes seven straight years with at least 30 starts, at least 180 innings, and an ERA between 3.51 and 4.18. The draft pick is the biggest concern, but a declining strikeout rate may also be causing teams pause. Gallardo induced swinging strikes just 6.5% of the time last season, and as his walk rate edged back up, his strikeout to walk ratio fell beneath two. That thins his margin for error, which he accounts for by keeping the ball on the ground and mostly in the park, and his batted balls produce largely average results. He'll be a bit dependent on defense an the lack of strikeouts makes it easy to envision a bad year forthcoming (his FIP and xFIP were career-worsts of 4.00 and 4.31), perhaps making him more of a right-handed J.A. Happ than someone worthy of giving four years to and losing a pick for. Depending on his landing spot, he might be somewhere around the 100th-best starter in mixed leagues. That's something, for some leagues. (Blake Murphy)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Gallardo put together a seventh consecutive season of 30 starts, 180 innings, and a decent ERA. A serious lack of swing and misses, an uptick in walks, and a dependence on defense and landing spot render his upside pretty low relative to his previous ERAs.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>
