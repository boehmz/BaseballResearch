The top prospect made a name for himself with a sweet swing and a great approach at the plate (16.1% strikeout rate in Triple-A last year with a 9.6% walk rate), but that fell apart when he made the leap to Cleveland. In just over a third of a season, Chisenhall walked just eight times (just seven times unintentionally) and paired a putrid 3.6% BB-rate with a K-rate of 22%. However, the rest of his skills stayed solid -- he maintained a .160 ISO, not far from his Triple-A numbers, and hit decently on balls in play. Assuming he can bring the strikeouts down and the walks up (and as he adjusts to MLB pitching, both of those things should happen) he should settle in as a .275-.280 hitter with 20 HR power and solid RBI numbers, since he will likely be hitting behind guys like Carlos Santana and Travis Hafner. The question is, will that happen in 2012 or later? Chisenhall may not be a safe bet as your opening day starter at 3B, but he is well-worth owning and could prove to be a solid, inexpensive play at the season goes on.

Rough enough that there is talk of giving Carlos Santana -- a weak defensive catcher who has not exactly shined in time at first base -- a third baseman's glove to see what he can do. In what amounts to basically one full season's worth of stats, Chisenhall has struck out in nearly 1-in-5 plate appearances while walking in only 1-in-20. This isn't an unmitigated disaster (Adam Jones posted a higher strikeout rate and lower walk rate last season), but it is not good either. He has swung at 38.9% of pitches outside the zone. Again, not the worst number you will see, but not good. He makes decent contact, and doesn't swing through many pitches, but for a guy whose reputation was as a line-drive hitter with a sweet swing, his 20.9% line drive rate is not pretty enough. But we need to remember, he is still only 25 and has basically had only year of plate appearances - and never much consistent playing time. He looked awfully good in limited playing time in September (.270/.325/.595 despite a .233 batting average on balls in play in 40 PA), and I can't imagine the Indians actually trotting Santana out to third base. In deep leagues, he may be worth a flyer. In shallower leagues, he is worth watching. But while he is post-hype, I am not yet ready to call him a sleeper. (<a href="https://twitter.com/chadyoung">Chad Young</a>)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Chisenhall has been bad, no doubt, but he has yet to get 700 plate appearances in his career, and hasn't gotten much consistent playing time.

It's not that the Texas game was his only good game of the year -- he was hitting .365/.413/.538 in 176 PA even before that night, but it was that night that convinced Indians fans they had a new Lonnie Chisenhall, until the old Lonnie Chisenhall showed back up. Chisenhall displayed a new approach in 2014, favoring a more line-drive heavy approach at the expense of some of his power. Without any speed or defense, Chisenhall's entire value comes from his bat, and while his bat improved last year, there are still legitimate concerns that it can hold up at third base at the major league level. Nevertheless, the only real threat to Chisenhall's playing time is Giovanny Urshela, and he'll open the season at Triple-A.

Not surprisingly, Steamer expects something that looks an awful lot like that line. It's not an awful line, but it would look a lot better from a middle infielder than a corner guy.

Almost six years later, he has carved out a niche as a solid defensive right fielder, primarily used in a platoon role, and putting up solid 1-2 win seasons for the Indians. Unfortunately for fantasy owners, the profile that makes him a solid contributor on a pennant-winning team is not particularly interesting in our world. His rates won't kill you, but his six stolen bases in 2016 were his most since Low-A, and only 51 of his nearly 2,000 MLB plate appearances have ended in home runs. There could always be a breakout waiting, but now 28 years old, Chisenhall is past the point where you want to bet on that. 10, maybe 15 HR and 3-5 steals won't cut it and it's hard to imagine there is more coming.(<a href="https://twitter.com/chadyoung" style="color: #408725;">Chad Young</a>)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>There was a time that I was dreaming on a version of Lonnie Chisenhall with a swing tailor-made for .300 averages, 20 home runs, and the athleticism to add a handful of steals.

That's a pretty solid comp for Chisenhall in 2016. (Chad Young)", 
            "quickProfile": "Chisenhall has been up-and-down and back again over the last couple years, but when you add it all up, you are talking about a guy likely outside the top-15 third basemen but inside the top-20, perhaps with some upside."},{"season": "2017",
            "profile": "In 2011, Lonnie Chisenhall was ranked number 25 on Baseball America's pre-season Top 100 list, and it looked like just a matter of time before he was a sweet-swinging, line-drive scattering third baseman with solid fantasy value hitting in the middle of Cleveland's lineup. Almost six years later, he has carved out a niche as a solid defensive right fielder, primarily used in a platoon role, and putting up solid 1-2 win seasons for the Indians. Unfortunately for fantasy owners, the profile that makes him a solid contributor on a pennant-winning team is not particularly interesting in our world. His rates won't kill you, but his six stolen bases in 2016 were his most since Low-A, and only 51 of his nearly 2,000 MLB plate appearances have ended in home runs. There could always be a breakout waiting, but now 28 years old, Chisenhall is past the point where you want to bet on that. 10, maybe 15 HR and 3-5 steals won't cut it and it's hard to imagine there is more coming.(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/chadyoung\" style=\"color: #408725;\">Chad Young</a>)", 
            "quickProfile": "There was a time that I was dreaming on a version of Lonnie Chisenhall with a swing tailor-made for .300 averages, 20 home runs, and the athleticism to add a handful of steals. That dream never quite came true, and while Chisenhall has turned into a solid major leaguer, he's not an exciting fantasy player."},{"season": "2018",
            "profile": "Sample sizes aside, Lonnie Chisenhall produced his best offensive season in 2017, nearly matching his best single-season home run total in half the plate appearances. He joined the Fly Ball Revolution™ and pushed his <abbr title=\"hard contact\">Hard%</abbr> well north of 30% for the first time. It’s possible he has laid the groundwork for a full-blown post-hype breakout. It feels crazy to say he could hit .280 with 25 home runs as Cleveland’s starting right fielder, but he could.  It depends if Cleveland envisions Chisenhall their true starting right fielder. Brandon Guyer could bite chunks out of his playing time. Although Jason Kipnis allegedly will start at second base, both he and Jose Ramirez have the versatility to crowd Chisenhall out of plate appearances, too, and that’s before considering how the beleaguered Melvin Upton Jr. might fit into the equation.  Fortunately for fantasy owners, Chisenhall won’t be anything more than a late-round gamble in most leagues. If he regresses to vintage Chisenhall in 2018, he’s a sunk cost, but a small one. If he sustains his 2017 small-sample gains, he will be relevant in all league formats and carry top-40-outfielder upside. It’s hard to ignore his long track record of mediocrity when enticing prospects exist around the same <abbr title=\"average draft position\">ADP</abbr>, but there’s an outside chance he rewards owners handsomely with a 25-5-.280 line. Keep him in mind in the late goings. (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/DolphHauldhagen\">Alex Chamberlain</a>)", 
            "quickProfile": "Lonnie Chisenhall flashed some interesting skills gains in 2017; only 2018 will tell if they’ll hold under duress of a larger sample. His cheap draft stock makes him a low-risk, moderate-upside, high-post-hype investment who could hit .280 with 25 home runs at virtually no cost to a trusting fantasy owner."}]; </script>
