In this one, however, Reed seems to have a hammerlock on the job and Santiago and his screw ball must be content as a set-up man.

Angel Stadium plays much better for home runs, which has been Santiago's biggest issue in his brief career. Santiago is capable of posting decent strikeout totals based on a deceptive fastball and decent change up, but it comes at the expense of high walk numbers. Despite taking some steps forward last season, he can still be somewhat maddening on the mound when he's off. Maybe it's the screwball -- it's only a good pitch when it's down, and he struggles to keep it down. Or maybe it's just a lack of a real out-pitch. He's been able to outperform his FIP by quite a bit in his first two seasons, so it's tough to expect him to post another 3.50 ERA next season. But pitching in his new home stadium should help, and could make him a nice source of strikeouts late in fantasy drafts. (<a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_Cwik">Chris Cwik</a>)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Santiago should benefit from his move to Los Angeles. The strikeout totals are nice, but they come with a ton of walks as well.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

Plus, he allowed the highest weighted offense against that pitch compared with all others he has thrown throughout his career. Instead, he now comes at batters with a variety of stuff, none of which sport a whiff rate above 10% for his career. With no out pitch, one wonders how he has posted a career strikeout rate above 20%. The answer is that he has gotten a significantly higher rate of both called and foul strikes than the average pitcher, both of which are real skills, though not quite as reliable as the swinging strike. He still possesses below-average control and allows a hefty rate of fly balls. Anaheim is a great place to play as a fly ball pitcher, but the overall skill set is uninspiring. He'll have to continue to outperform his SIERA marks to maintain any semblance of fantasy value, which is rarely something I like to bet on happening. (<a href="https://www.projectingx.com" target="_blank" onclick="return false;">Mike Podhorzer</a>)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>An assortment of off-speed pitches has boosted Santiago's called and foul strike rates, which has resulted in solid strikeout rates despite underwhelming whiff marks. But the overall skill set here is rather soft and one wonders how much longer he could significantly outperform his SIERA. I don't want to be his owner when the ERA finally does converge with the SIERA.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

Starting with the good -- he struck out an acceptable number of batters for every fantasy league type. Over the past two seasons, his 7.9 strikeouts per nine rank 35th (minimum 250 innings pitched). This value is higher than the one put up by Jordan Zimmermann, Michael Wacha, Julio Teheran, or Dallas Keuchel over the same time frame. Strikeouts are not his issue. He does have an insanely low ground ball rate. Chris Young (24% GB%) is the only pitcher who allowed fewer ground balls over the past two season than Santiago (30%). The low number of ground balls has led to an above-average 1.3 home runs per nine innings rate. Some of those fly balls will leave the yard. On the other hand, if the fly ball doesn’t leave the ballpark, it is generally an out as seen by his .269 batting average on balls in play and ERA (3.82) which is about a whole run lower than his FIP (4.93), xFIP (4.83) and SIERA (4.48). Santiago’s biggest issue is his command. Over the past two seasons, his 3.70 walks per nine is the fifth highest rate out of 100 pitchers (min 250 IP). He could really move into an elite pitcher if he could drop his BB/9 to around 2.00. Don’t expect anything to change for 2016 though, just use his 2015 stats as his 2016 baselines. (Jeff Zimmerman)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Santiago has the potential to move into the top echelon of pitchers if he can get the walks under control. Until then, he will lean on his low ground ball rate, nice home park, and high strikeout totals to keep getting by.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

Last season was going well on the surface with the Angels as he had an ERA of 4.25 with a 10-4 record. However, up until that point, fielding independent pitching has always told a different story as Santiago has consistently outperformed his FIP. Could Santiago be the type of pitcher who goes against these advanced numbers? Well, he was moved to Minnesota and the answer became a resounding no as his ERA shot up to 5.58 and his career 77% left-on base percentage went down to 70%, helping to eliminate the narrative that he just knew how to pitch out of jams. More interestingly, his strikeout per 9 went down to 5 in Minnesota, which is over 2 Ks less than his traditional numbers. Santiago was never an overwhelming power pitcher, but for somebody who gives up as many home runs as he does, losing two strikeouts per 9 will crush your performance. The key question for Santiago is whether the strikeouts will come back, and if so, can he continue to outperform his FIP the same way he did with the Angels for years. (Paul Kastava)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>The other show dropped for Santiago as years of outperforming his FIP finally came back to bite him on the rear in Minnesota. If the strikeouts return, will we see the Santiago that pitched with the Angels or will the FIP gods continue to make up for lost time?</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>
