            "profile": "Justin Smoak’s post-hype breakout may have been three years in the making. His arrival in Toronto coincided with his first legitimate 30-homer pace. Then the launch angle rebounded in 2016 while retaining most of his <abbr title=\"hard contact rate\">Hard%</abbr> gains. Finally, in 2017, it all came together – the fly balls, the power, a full season worth of plate appearances and, unexpectedly, a robust improvement in contact skills. (Or, alternatively, a revival of contact skills lying dormant for half a decade.) By Statcast’s expected <abbr title=\"weighted on-base average\">wOBA</abbr>, the breakout was authentic.  The Blue Jays allegedly <a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/blue-jays-spring-takeaways-justin-smoak-getting-swing-gear/\">saw this upside in Smoak</a> hearkening back to his debut with them in 2015. If they saw potential in a seemingly lost cause, they deserve credit for tapping into it. It’s easy to dismiss an age-30 breakout from any player, let alone a busted top prospect who burned fantasy owners for years. Yet everything here looks sustainable, especially if you subscribe to the notion if a player flashes a skill once (e.g., plate discipline), he owns it.  Smoak rounds out the top-20 first basemen in <abbr title=\"National Fantasy Baseball Championship\">NFBC</abbr> drafts, indicating skepticism. Something resembling a repeat – say, 30 home runs and a .250 average – should turn an easy profit on that price. He’s surprisingly less risky than he seems on paper and is a worthy corner infielder in all formats. (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/DolphHauldhagen\">Alex Chamberlain</a>) (Alex Chamberlain )",

There are still flaws here, but early skepticism has suppressed his price relative to other middling first basemen.
