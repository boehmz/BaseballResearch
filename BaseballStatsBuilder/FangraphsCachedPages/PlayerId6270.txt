            "profile": "At one point, the former first overall pick of the 2008 draft looked like he’d never be more than a backup utility player – the kind you prefer to keep stashed in Triple-A. Tim Beckham broke out over the last two seasons, combining a surprise burst of power with a surge of hard contact. Upon a mid-season trade to Baltimore, he took another step forward by trimming his swinging strike and strikeout rates to acceptable levels. It’s still easy to look at the profile and see why he might fail. His 22 home runs were built on the back of a 20.6% HR/FB ratio. For most of his minor league career, he posted sub-10% HR/FB rates. He’s a pull-happy ground ball hitter which should make him shiftable. The high balls in play averages he’s posted during his breakout may prove to be flukes. It’s worth noting that he became more of a spray hitter upon joining the Orioles. He also cut his whiff rate. His low-angle, hard-contact profile bears some similarity to an aggressive, lower-contact version of Christian Yelich or Tommy Pham. There’s definitely a chance he continues to produce at an above-average level. He could also find himself slapped to Norfolk by the regression monster. (Brad Johnson)", 
            "quickProfile": "Beckham was just another busted prospect until he started swatting home runs last season. The Rays are likely kicking themselves for dumping him before the peak of his breakout. Meanwhile, the Orioles ought to be pleased that they converted a low-minors pitcher into three years of Beckham - even if Manny Machado has temporarily pushed him to a third base/super-utility role."}]; </script>
