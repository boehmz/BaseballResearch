During his tenure in Arizona, Bauer's insistence that we would not alter his training methods was perceived as stubbornness. Whether he was right or not, Arizona's search for "gritty" team players begot Bauer's departure. In Cleveland, Bauer will start fresh and should compete for a place in the Indians' rotation.

Forget the ugly numbers in Cleveland. Ignore the 5.29 ERA which was somehow lower than his FIP (7.05) or that he somehow posted a walk rate that was higher than either (8.47 per nine -- seriously, in 17 innings he walked 16). Instead, look at his numbers in Columbus -- the 4.15 ERA is not terrible (although not particularly prospect-y) but the 5.08 FIP isn't pretty and his walk rate was AGAIN higher than either other number (5.41). Gone, too, were the prolific strikeout numbers from earlier in his career. If you want to be optimistic though, you just have to look past the numbers. Bauer, despite a reputation for rejecting coaching, spent much of the 2013 season reworking his delivery and has been in constant contact with Indians staff this off-season. They might be biased, having shipped off a newly-minted $130MM man to get Bauer, but the Indians are encouraged and there are reports that he is again showing the electricity that made him one of baseball's top prospects. I imagine Bauer will start 2014 in Triple-A, but in deep leagues or leagues with minor league spots, he is worth a flyer. He may not recapture past glory, but if he does, you'll want to be along for the ride. (<a href="https://twitter.com/chadyoung">Chad Young</a>)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Statistically, 2013 was an unmitigated disaster for Bauer. But he is working on a new approach, taking to coaching, and the reports in the off-season are encouraging. Don't count on anything, but don't forget that this was one of the most highly touted arms in all of baseball.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

There's no better way to project future performance, and so we use them often. But they're not always perfect, and they're not meant to be taken as gospel. The systems miss badly on some players, and some guys are just hard to project. Trevor Bauer is one of those guys where I will be ignoring the projections. By Steamer, Bauer is projected to be essentially replacement-level in 2015 after a solid first full year in 2014. It's likely because his first eight starts went as terrible as humanly possible. Bauer walked almost everybody, and the ones he didn't walk took him deep. These impossibly bad results lead to a nasty projection, but what the projections don't know is that Bauer was a top prospect, that he studies the science of pitching perhaps more than any player in the league, and that he completely re-worked his mechanics, which are now much more efficient and allow him to increase his velocity even after 100 pitches. Sure, Bauer has his warts. The walk rate is still ugly and he seems to have a penchant for hard contact. But the strikeout rate is also still lower than people expected and he's still just 24 years old. (<a href="https://twitter.com/AugustF_ABJ">August Fagerstrom</a>)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Don't put too much stock in the projections for Trevor Bauer's 2015. Instead, make your own. Everybody's got their own opinion on Bauer -- he's a divisive player. But legitimate improvements to his mechanics in 2014 lead me to believe it's just as likely he improves upon his 2014 numbers, rather than regress.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

Is he a bust? His final 2015 numbers might leave you feeling that way. 4.55 ERA, 4.33 FIP, 4.0 walks and 1.2 homers per game, neither of which can be sustained without an elite strikeout rate which he does not have (8.7 strikeouts per nine). Or is he an elite prospect with some post-hype sleeper potential? If you cherry pick a bit: in April, May and September, he threw 83 innings (almost half his season) with 83 strikeouts and 37 walks (9 K/9, 4.01 BB/9), but controlled the long ball (.53 HR/9) leading to a 3.80 ERA and an even better FIP. The difference? His home run per fly ball rate. When he avoids the long ball, he pitches well enough. How about another cut -- he had 16 starts (out of 30) with 5+ innings pitched and three or fewer walks. He still gave up too many home runs (1.2 HR/9) in those starts, but his ERA was 2.85. So if he avoids the free pass, he pitches extremely well. There is still hope for Bauer. If he can limit the walks, even with the home runs, he'll be very good. If he can limit BOTH, he can still be elite. I wouldn't bet heavily on either, but he's worth a flyer in deeper formats and worth tracking in all leagues. (Chad Young)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>When Bauer walks people, he pitches poorly. When he doesn't, he doesn't pitch poorly. If he finds the control, he can be a fantasy diamond in the rough, just don't pay too high a price to find out.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>
