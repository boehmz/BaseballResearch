His defense is quite poor, but that should not matter to fantasy owners. Moreover, the Astros do not have anyone at the moment who could threaten Castro's playing time in 2013. That is not to say that he is about to threaten Buster Posey's place among National League catchers -- far from it. However, he looks like he could be a league-average hitter, which would make him a very good hitter relative to his position, indeed. Castro has always been patient, and while his strikeout rate is worse than average, it is not exceptionally bad. What really helped his offense in 2012 was driving the ball better -- both for hits and for extra bases. Again, these are not superstar level abilities, and while there is some upside for a 26-year-old, it is not excessive. However, if he can stay healthy and play 120 or more games in 2013, he might hit 10 home runs and put up a .260/.340/.400 line, which would be just fine for a National League catcher.
