Arizona certainly didn't expect below replacement work from their Cuban import Yasmany Tomas. He struggled to find a position, as the Diamondbacks (inexplicably) played him at third base for 272 painful innings, where the metrics and the eye tests agreed that he was terrible. He wasn't much better in the corner outfield spots, where the metrics said he was one of the worst outfielders in baseball. Any thoughts of his offense offsetting his defense went by the wayside rather quickly. A .273 batting average is fine, but not if it doesn't come with patience and power. There's no doubt Tomas has raw power, but it didn't translate to game action. He had a below-average .128 isolated slugging percentage, 4% walk rate and 25.8% strikeout rate. He only had 31 extra base hits in 426 plate appearances. He also had a high .354 batting average on balls in play that doesn't mean a whole lot because he doesn't have the speed to take advantage of it. Perhaps with a full year under his belt, Tomas could see improvement in 2016 and beyond. A strong Arizona lineup should help, but he'll also struggle to find 500 plate appearances on a Diamondback squad set on contending if he isn't producing. (Dustin Nosler)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Tomas was expected to be a big hitter the Diamondbacks could pair with Paul Goldschmidt, but his disappointing rookie campaign produced just a .273/.305/.401 triple slash and nine home runs. He was one of the least valuable players in 2015.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

In 2016 he began hitting the ball into the air more often, and with greater authority, pushing his flyball rate from 23.2% in 2015 to 31.4% in 2016. He also pulled 41.0% of these balls, as opposed to 31.6% in 2015, holding opposite field contact roughly consistent. He also hit nearly twice as many home runs per fly ball, climbing all the way to 25%. Through all of this his SwStrk% went up to a worrying 16.3%, the second worst among qualified batters, only behind Kris Davis, but Tomas managed to slightly decrease his strikeout rate and increase his walk rate from 2015. Tomas finished the season as an easy top 80 position player in fantasy baseball, and a top 30 outfielder. Tomas is not a good runner and he will never steal bases, but if he can continue hitting with this sort of power his fantasy value will continue to climb. Especially if he keeps that strikeout rate under control. (Andrew Perpetua)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>There is risk attached to Tomas going into 2017, but his improved power appears to be sustainable. A repeat of last season would make him a bargain around the 140 overall pick.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

            "profile": "Yasmany Tomas underwent multiple core surgeries in what amounted to a lost 2017 season. What we saw of him looked the same: lots of power, lots of strikeouts, lots of horrendous defense. Fortunately, the latter doesn’t matter for fantasy purposes until the Diamondbacks deem it too much of a liability to endure. There’s a chance Tomas is still experiencing discomfort by the time the 2018 season rolls around; assuming he’s not, he’s a lock for 25 home runs and a .260 batting average. In deeper formats, you could do worse. Give him a full 650 plate appearances and he’ll threaten to repeat his 35-homer, .275ish-average pace from 2016, which plays up in any format.  Unfortunately, the recent offseason signing of Steven Souza Jr. all but stifles Tomas' production potential. There's little room for him in a crowded outfield, and it appears the Diamondbacks might be cutting bait on their mercurial hitter. His top-125 upside (yes, really) warrants a speculative pick in NL-only leagues, but he's otherwise a useless fantasy commodity until further notice. (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/DolphHauldhagen\">Alex Chamberlain</a>)", 
            "quickProfile": "Yasmany Tomas lost 2017 to surgeries, and he'll lose 2018 to missed playing time. His power warrants a dart throw in super-deep formats, but the signing of Steven Souza Jr. might signal the beginning of the end of Tomas' time in Arizona."}]; </script>
