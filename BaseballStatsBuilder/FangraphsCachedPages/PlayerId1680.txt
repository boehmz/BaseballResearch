That's not to say he'll collapse, but rather that he set an unattainable precedent last year. His peripherals still suggest that he can continue pitching effectively in 2011 and the future, and that goes more so if he can cut his walk rate (not all that uncommon for players as they get into their mid-20s). Even if he doesn't, he still produced a league average strikeout rate and one of the best ground ball rates in the league last season. If there's one concern it's his increased workload. Garcia had never thrown more than 122 innings in a season before last year, and thanks to Tommy John surgery he was limited to just 37.2 innings in 2009 before throwing 163.1 innings last year. Still, he didn't seem to tire too badly. He figures to be a solid contributor in 2011.  (Joe Pawlikowski)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Jaime Garcia's 2010 ERA is not sustainable, but his strikeout rate and ground ball rates could keep his ERA well below average. If more control comes with maturity, he could also see a lower WHIP in 2011.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

Largely behind a 53.6% ground ball rate as well as improved control, Garcia posted a 3.56 ERA despite only stranding two-thirds of his runners. Garcia's peripherals are already first-rate – his strikeout-to-walk ratio eclipsed 3.0 last season. With a normal strand rate next season, Garcia should reach a borderline ace level behind Chris Carpenter and Adam Wainwright in the Cardinals' rotation. He'll never get the strikeouts of a fantasy ace though. (Jack Moore)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Garcia earned himself a five-year deal in 2011, and should continue to be a more than capable top-of-the-rotation arm, largely thanks to his excellent changeup.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

His strikeout rate has hovered around the league average, his ground-ball percentage has been well above average at 53-55%, and his home run rate has remained below average at .50-.60 home runs per nine. Last season did mark a shift in run prevention, as he posted a below-average ERA (3.92 ERA, 102 ERA-) for the first time since making the full-time jump to the big leagues, but his 2.97 FIP indicates he actually threw the ball extremely well. The culprit was the .339 batting average on balls in play and 69.1% strand rate. In fact, Garcia had the fifth-highest BABIP amongst starters who threw at least 100 innings in 2012. Expect his ERA to decrease significantly as his BABIP decreases in 2013. Keep in mind, though, Garcia dealt with a shoulder injury last year and also has seen his fastball velocity drop two miles per hour over the past two years. He already had Tommy John surgery following the 2008 season, so any elbow or shoulder injuries should raise red flags. Fantasy owners would be wise to see if the left-hander proves healthy in the World Baseball Classic this March before drafting him for their fantasy roster. (JP Breen)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Garcia is a solid number-three starter for your fantasy rotation when healthy, but shoulder issues plagued his 2012 campaign and cast a large shadow over his 2013 outlook.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

The Cardinals expect the 27-year-old to be at full health in time for Spring Training, and general manager John Mozeliak has publicly stated that he expects Garcia to be in the rotation, not the bullpen. Regardless of any official statements, Garcia will be a pretty big risk for fantasy owners. The recovery rate from shoulder surgeries is wildly unpredictable, and Garcia will be on the fringe of relevance in mixed fantasy leagues if he's anything less than 100% of his former self. A fully healthy Garcia can be counted on for an earned run average in the 3.50-4.00 range, with a walks plus hits per inning around 1.35 and seven punchouts per nine innings. The question is whether he'll be at 100% health. (<a href="https://twitter.com/ScottStrandberg">Scott Strandberg</a>)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Because he missed nearly an entire season, Garcia will be a bit of a forgotten man for fantasy purposes this year. He can likely be had with a late-round pick or low auction bid, with the upside to be a solid back-of-the-rotation fantasy starter. The possible reward is higher than the minimal risk associated with acquiring him.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

This time, thoracic outlet syndrome was the culprit. The team was a bit peeved with how he handled the injury, but he's under contract for at least one more season at $9.25 million (with a couple option years to boot). Garcia was solid in his return to the majors after missing part of 2012 and most of 2013. He featured good control with 1.44 walks per nine and decent swing-and-miss stuff with 8.04 strikeouts per nine and a 12.2% swinging strike rate. Fantasy owners will have to tread lightly in order not to break their fragile play toy, especially in keeper leagues. If you're in a deep league, there are probably worse ways to spend your last dollar or pick. He has a nice, deep arsenal when he's out there. (Brad Johnson)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>For the Cardinals, Garcia's shoulder is an enemy of the state. If he ever manages a full season, he could be a useful innings eater for St. Louis and fantasy owners alike. He's good during the rare times he is healthy.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

Yes, Jaime Garcia's had it. Rotator cuff surgery? Yes, he has had that, too. Thoracic outlet surgery? Indeed, that has been another of the procedures Jaime Garcia has undergone to try and keep pitching at the major league level. After pitching nearly 200 innings in 2011, Garcia made 20 starts in 2012, and then just 16 in 2013 and 2014 combined. In 2015, Garcia was in the last year of his contract with the Cardinals that he signed during the 2011 season, and nothing was expected of Garcia, his option years irrelevant. A setback in spring training was no surprise, but then to almost everyone's surprise Garcia came back, and pitched very well. Garcia has five above-average pitches that he uses to confuse hitters, racking up ground ball outs. In nearly 130 innnings last year, Garcia walked hitters less than 6% of the time and kept the ball in the yard by inducing ground balls on more than 60% of balls in play. Add in average strikeout totals, and Garcia's FIP (3.00) and ERA (2.44) were both excellent. The results when he pitches you can count on. That he will pitch at all will always be less clear. (Craig Edwards)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Jaime Garcia will always be a huge health risk, and he is not somewhat to count on.

Yet after pitching admirably through April and May, he absolutely bombed from June onward. It's an unfair characterization of his season - his 3.77 xFIP points to the abominable 20.2% home run-to-fly ball rate (HR/FB) that obliterated his season. It just seems like Garcia was a primary victim of last year's home run surge. His strikeout and walk rates never overwhelm, but he's still a ground ball king with no discernible weaknesses otherwise-- well, except for his health, but at this point, it's a well-established risk. Garcia's move from St. Louis to Atlanta dings his draft stock pretty hard, but he was never going to be a mixed-league starter for you anyway. He's rebound material, albeit one with limited upside. You can probably land him in NL-only leagues on the cheap, and he'll make for a fine starter for as long as he's healthy. Otherwise, his days of mid-3.00 ERAs and middling strikeout rates, while not necessarily behind him, are not particularly helpful in this day and age of massive whiffs and dominant young arms. (Alex Chamberlain)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Jaime Garcia won't be anywhere near as bad as he was last year, but he also doesn't have the upside his ground ball tendencies and base runner prevention might suggest. Being in Atlanta won't do him any favors, either. He's best left for deep mixed leagues and NL-only formats, although he could probably be bought at basement prices given his awful 2016 and history of poor health.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>
