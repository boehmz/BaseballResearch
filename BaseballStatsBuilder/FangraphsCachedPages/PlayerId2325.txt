However, the discipline which brought walk rates of 10% or higher in the minors appears to be gone. For the second straight season, Lucroy posted a walk rate in the 6% range. Given his low spot in the batting order, he isn't likely to post much in the way of counting stats, but unlike many of the catchers in the league, he isn't going to kill a single stat either -- he even stole two bases last season.

He hit .320/.368/.513 in 346 plate appearances last year and owned the third-highest wOBA (.378) amongst all catchers with at least 300 PAs. Strikeouts had become a concern in 2011, but he almost cut his strikeout rate in half to 12.7% and only had a 5.6% swinging-strike rate. Some have pointed to his .338 batting average on balls in play as a reason to temper excitement heading into 2013. Lucroy is a line-drive hitter, however, and has a career .315 BABIP. His batting average won't suffer dramatically if his BABIP comes down to his career average. The Brewers' potent offense should help his RBI and run totals throughout the year, too.

Many owners forget he posted a fantastic .378 weighted on-base average with 12 home runs in only 346 plate appearances in 2012. More importantly, he backed it up over a whole season by hitting .280/.340/.455 with 18 homers and a .175 isolated slugging percentage last year. The improved performance at the plate coincided with a large jump in his contact rate between 2011 and 2012, which was 83.7% to 87.6%, respectively. He consequently cut his strikeout rate in half, and those positive contact trends carried over into the 2013 season. There are two main reasons why Lucroy was the fifth-ranked fantasy catcher last year despite ranking tenth in wOBA amongst catchers with at least 300 PAs: (1) his 580 plate appearances were third-most in the league for catchers, which meant more opportunities to amass counting statistics, and (2) he produces in every category. For example, his nine stolen bases were tops at the position. Pay attention to where he bats in the Brewers' batting order because with the return of Ryan Braun and Aramis Ramirez, he could either move down to fifth/sixth or up to the two-slot. Both will impact his potential fantasy output, but he's safely a top-10 catcher no matter what and could push for more depending upon his batting average on balls in play. (JP Breen)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>Lucroy is easily a top-10 catcher heading into the 2014 season.

Lucroy features good plate discipline with strong contact skills like the Tiger, including a 5% swinging strike rate, 10.1% walk rate, and 10.8% strikeout rate. The combination allows him to bat around .300 with a strong on base percentage. There is definitely upside for more home runs from Lucroy's bat.

His fly ball rate peaked after bottoming out in 2015, propelling him to his first 20-homer season (and then some). He continued hitting with authority; his hard hit rate ranks third among catchers since 2012, better than Evan Gattis, Yasmani Grandal, Brian McCann, Carlos Santana, and basically every active catcher (or former catcher) known for power. It's just that Lucroy is more of a gap hitter whose all-fields approach befits a lofted batting average on balls in play (BABIP) at the expense of power. Last year was different, obviously. It coincided with career-high strikeout and pop-up rates — he hit almost as many bloopers last year as he did in all of 2012-15 combined — so it seems like he deliberately sold out for power. Heading into 2017, the worst-case scenario for Lucroy would see his power regressing but the strikeouts sticking around - a repeat of his 2015 season, essentially, minus the DL stint. That version of Lucroy was still above average, though, albeit barely, so an investment in Lucroy is an investment in a solid floor with excellent upside. There's a new sheriff of backstops in town — he's young, he's a Yankee, and he's related to the prodigious Pablo Sanchez, no doubt — but there's virtually no justifying a decision to draft Lucroy outside the top-3 at the position. (Alex Chamberlain)<br /><br /><b>The Quick Opinion: </b>The 2016 season showed us a different but equally productive side of Lucroy, who loaded up on both home runs and strikeouts en route to becoming fantasy baseball's best catcher. Whether he hits .300 with a dozen homers or .270 with two dozen homers, Lucroy figures again to be one of baseball's elite backstops.</td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr>

            "quickProfile": "A toe injury and concussion limited Jonathan Lucroy to 103 games played and worse offensive production than usual.  However, in the three years previous, Lucroy had established himself as one of the best hitting catchers in baseball.  Returning healthy in 2016, look for him to reassert himself among the top five fantasy catchers."},{"season": "2017",
            "profile": "Lucroy seems to have fixed whatever was wrong with his swing last year. His fly ball rate peaked after bottoming out in 2015, propelling him to his first 20-homer season (and then some). He continued hitting with authority; his hard hit rate ranks third among catchers since 2012, better than Evan Gattis, Yasmani Grandal, Brian McCann, Carlos Santana, and basically every active catcher (or former catcher) known for power. It's just that Lucroy is more of a gap hitter whose all-fields approach befits a lofted batting average on balls in play (BABIP) at the expense of power. Last year was different, obviously. It coincided with career-high strikeout and pop-up rates — he hit almost as many bloopers last year as he did in all of 2012-15 combined — so it seems like he deliberately sold out for power. Heading into 2017, the worst-case scenario for Lucroy would see his power regressing but the strikeouts sticking around - a repeat of his 2015 season, essentially, minus the DL stint. That version of Lucroy was still above average, though, albeit barely, so an investment in Lucroy is an investment in a solid floor with excellent upside. There's a new sheriff of backstops in town — he's young, he's a Yankee, and he's related to the prodigious Pablo Sanchez, no doubt — but there's virtually no justifying a decision to draft Lucroy outside the top-3 at the position. (Alex Chamberlain)", 
            "quickProfile": "The 2016 season showed us a different but equally productive side of Lucroy, who loaded up on both home runs and strikeouts en route to becoming fantasy baseball's best catcher. Whether he hits .300 with a dozen homers or .270 with two dozen homers, Lucroy figures again to be one of baseball's elite backstops."},{"season": "2018",
            "profile": "Lucroy was one of fantasy baseball’s most productive catchers from 2012-2016, but his fall from grace was shockingly abrupt. Even at such a shallow position, Lucroy was the No. 23 catcher in standard leagues last year, and his vanishing power production was the culprit. After hitting a career-high 24 homers in 2016, the 31-year-old managed just six dingers last year, which is even more shocking considering he played his 2017 home games in two extreme hitters parks (Texas and Colorado). He also didn’t produce nearly enough in other categories to even come close to making up for the power outage. Furthermore, batted ball data supports Lucroy’s sudden inability to hit the ball with any authority. After recording a hard hit rate of ~35% in each of his previous five seasons, Lucroy had a paltry 22.3% Hard% in 2017. He also hit a downright comical number of grounders, with a jaw-dropping 53.5% GB rate, compared to the 37.2% GB rate he recorded in the previous season. (Scott Strandberg)", 
            "quickProfile": "While it is important to note that he’s just one year removed from a very productive season, Lucroy was so extremely bad last year that it’s fair to wonder if he’s done. He remains unsigned at the time of this writing, and is nothing more than a late-round desperation dart throw in 2018 fantasy drafts."}]; </script>
