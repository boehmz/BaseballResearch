The good news is that he's still just 23 years old, having been on the prospect radar since he was 16. Flores looks like a power hitter but he has yet to show much pop in two brief big league stints. He also doesn't walk much, which puts added pressure on his ability to hit for a high average. On the plus side, he makes a lot of contact (11.3% strikeout rate) and has the frame to hit for power if he can make an adjustment or two.

It's not that Flores is behind all those players on the depth chart; it's just that, for a club that seems less than committed to Flores, that depth removes the chance that the Mets will rely on him in the near future. So whatever Flores possesses in terms of personal ability, he lacks in terms of opportunity at the moment. As for that personal ability, Flores certainly has promise.

Generally speaking, Wilmer is worth more in daily fantasy leagues than full season formats, but only when he maintains his substantial edge over left-handed pitching. Granted, these sorts of splits are subject to a lot of statistical noise between seasons, especially left-handed splits due to the small sample size, but his body of work against left-handed pitching has consistently shown a strong enough platoon advantage to make him a compelling pick in the correct league formats. Especially if he can manage league-average success rates against right-handed relief pitching. (Andrew Perpetua)",
