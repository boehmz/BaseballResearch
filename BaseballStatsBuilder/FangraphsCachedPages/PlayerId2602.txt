But there are reasons that Turner is very interesting in 2016, especially for fantasy purposes. He's only blocked by Stephen Drew, who has been worse than replacement for two years running now, and Danny Espinosa, who has been relegated to a backup role by his team before. Turner's contact rate was actually good in a small sample last year, too. It would have been top-20 had he qualified, and it's the kind of contact rate that Manny Machado and Jason Heyward have -- not the guys that strike out a third of the time, their contact rates are two to three times worse. Also, he has great speed and should beat his projected 20 steals if he gets the playing time. The tools are there for a good batting average with steals on the middle infield, and the opportunity is there, too.

            "profile": "Trea Turner is a fantasy baseball monster. He does it all. Stolen bases, double-digit homers, and high batting average all while playing a premium position. I guess you could knock him on his low RBI totals, but come on, don’t get greedy. Trea Turner was having a great season until he suffered a fractured wrist on a hit by pitch. Normally you might expect me to say he came back from the injury with reduced power numbers, right? Except that didn’t really happen to Turner. He was even better after the injury than he was prior to it. Of course, the injury caused him to miss eight weeks of playing time, which is very unfortunate, but he still managed to swipe 46 bags and score 75 runs. In 98 games. Let that sink in. We still haven’t seen a full season from Turner, but he is rated as the most valuable shortstop going into 2018. And frankly, it is by quite a margin. (Andrew Perpetua)", 
            "quickProfile": "I fully expect Trea Turner to continue to grow and evolve as a player over the coming few years. He saw a bit of a dip in exit velocity in 2017, perhaps in part due to the broken wrist. Adding that little boost of velocity into his mix could certainly help his power numbers."}]; </script>
